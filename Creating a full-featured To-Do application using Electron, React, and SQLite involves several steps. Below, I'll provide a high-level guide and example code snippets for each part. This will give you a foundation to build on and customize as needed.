Creating a full-featured To-Do application using Electron, React, and SQLite involves several steps. Below, I'll provide a high-level guide and example code snippets for each part. This will give you a foundation to build on and customize as needed.

1. Set Up the Project with Vite and Electron
Step 1: Initialize the Project
First, initialize the Vite project for React:

npm create vite@latest my-todo-app --template react
cd my-todo-app
npm install

Step 2: Add Electron
Add Electron and other necessary dependencies:

npm install electron electron-builder concurrently sqlite3


Step 3: Set Up Project Structure
Create the necessary files for Electron:

public/electron.js
public/preload.js
src/main.js (React entry point)
src/renderer.js (for rendering specific tasks)
